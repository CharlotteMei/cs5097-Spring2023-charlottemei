### Question1
Since the direction vector only indicates the direction, I don't think I would be able to calculate the location if the speed is not given. However, if the translation vector also indicates the speed, I will simply calculate the location at each timestamp as [start.x+vec.x*t, start.y+vec.y*t, start.z+vec.z*t]



### Question 2
I have not used the vector math library mainly due to my infamiliarity of the use of the library. Another reason for me to use my self-implemented functions is that I will have more control of the functions in case I will need to modify the process later.
